                <p>Good morning everyone.
                    My and Ruan's son has been a bad sleeper since childhood, he is now a year and almost 3 months. We didn't think anything of it when he was little but it remained a problem, he didn't wake up wide awake but he was terribly restless, rolling around all the time like he was uncomfortable. Very squirming and sometimes he just woke up and just screamed terribly. We were with 2 different pediatricians, 1 of whom gave us medication to get him to sleep and get into routine. It went well for about 2 weeks and after that it was the same again. There were good nights, but the majority was difficult. We also struggled terribly with his stomach. Very constipated,we had to give Lacson in the morning and evening just so his stomach does work, it's not even to get it normal. Lacson gives stomach cramps we recently realized because my mom drank it herself before she started GIPro and it gave her terrible cramps. We also struggled with his appetite from infancy, he drank very badly and we also struggled that he eats decently. Ever since we gave him Mannabears, 2 a day morning and afternoon and half a bag of GIPro he is a different child. His stomach works, he sleeps much better and he eats us out of the house. Don't think he's ever loved his milk so much. Very grateful to Mannatech! Mannabears and GIPro are essential for the little ones! 🙏🏻Thank you Mannatech! 🌸

                <h2>Testimonial</h2>
                    <p>Testimony about Diaper Dermatitis.....
My son is 2 years old and is given MannaBears, GI ProBalance, and ImmunoStart every day.
In early April 2020, he suddenly developed the most horrible RASH. It was strange because he had never struggled with burnt butts...... NEVER. When I saw that butt ointment and over-the-counter ointments didn't clear up the problem, I decided to consult a Dr. Due to COVID19, I sent the photos of the result to 2x doctors....
The 1st Doctor prescribed Quadruderm while the 2nd Doctor first wanted to consult a Dermatologist.
The Quadruderm immediately relieved the rash, but just before the rash was completely healed, the tube was finished and then the condition flared up. The prescription was repeated 2x.
Doctor No. 2 lets it be known that the Dermatologist is of the opinion that the result is an Infective Fungus Inflammation. The Dermatologist then sent a prescription with a cortisone/anti-fungal cream and Anti-Fungus drops that he should drink for Candida Spray. I was also warned to be patient because it was going to take months to get well. I then do what doctors ask you not to do, and google the causes for Candida infections and burns. Then I would realize that antibiotics can lead to burns...... that's when I realized that my son had tonsillitis at the end of March 2020 for which he had to take antibiotics. At the same time, the inexplicable burning began.
After the 1st application of the new ointment, the condition worsens drastically. The ointment completely seems to burn the skin.
I then made an appointment with a 4th doctor for advice. In the meantime, I threw ALL THE OINTMENTS AND PRESCRIPTIONS IN THE TRASH.
Dr No. 4 looked at the story this way and decided to take swabs for cultivation, from the area because they react like a resistant infection.
While we were waiting for the results, out of sheer desperation, I started giving my boy ADVANCED AMBROTOSE powder (2x scoops in the morning and 2 scoops in the evening), as well as GI PRO BALANCE (3X sachets in the morning and 3x sachets in the evening).
Before the results were known 3 days later, the buttocks had improved about 50%. The doctor called me very worried with a list of prescription medications and ointments (cortisone and antibiotics etc. etc.) because there were 2 bacteria cultured (staphylococcus and something else), as well as a long list of instructions e.g. bath in jik, bath with body lotion and not soap etc. etc....... I was warned again that it would be a lifelong condition as he had now developed sensitive, A-typical dermatitis.
Because the condition was suddenly so much better, I withheld the prescription at first. On day 10 the skin was completely healed without a scab, a lesion or any redness.... without ever picking up the prescription at pharmacy.
It's now 7 months later. Still, I haven't gone to pick up the prescription, and have never struggled with burnt butts again. In the meantime, my boy started potty training, and despite that, there has never been even a mild irritation again!
After almost 2 months of wrestling with cortisone and antibiotic ointments, the condition totaly healed in 10 days.

                <h2>Testimonial</h2>
                <p>Mila's path with Mannatech
Mila was born on January 9, 2018, she has struggled with sinus from that day on, so severe that it turns blue under her eyes. I, who am a working mom, couldn't stay at home, so Mila had to go to daycare, and later kindergarten. If there was a germ around, she would get very sick, we were more at the doctor and hospital than at school in the first year. I used most of the other products (immune boosters) on the market but nothing could keep her healthy.
When she turned 2 years old I first heard about Manatech's MANNABEARS, I thought if it was a natural product, it was healthier for her to use. Ordered and immediately started giving her a hand.
After the first 3 weeks, the sinuses were much better, and she no longer got sick briefly.
I forgot to order one month, and Mila got pneumonia, then we had to take her back to the hospital, the week after that her bears were dropped off and within a week Mila was healthy again.
Now I NEVER go without MANNABEARS, and when I see that nose start running I give Immunostart for 3 days, and everything is at an end.
Thank you Mannatech. Your products are the BEST!

                <h2>Testimonial</h2>
                <p>Premature Baby and Mom with heart problem</p>
<p>Our grandson was born after a very short pregnancy of only 27 weeks and mommy developing a heart problem. The Saturday evening her blood pressure was 250/180 and she gained 20kg's in 2 hours. Furthermore, the fluid started pushing over her Lungs and heart, which meant that he was not going to make it. The doctors decided to remove the baby and see if they could save her life. We prayed through the night and the Sunday morning they prepared her for the caesarian. Our son was not allowed to stand by as it would be too traumatic. 40 minutes later the trolley was pushed out of the theatre with a miniature screaming little baby of 1.1kg and 35cm long. 2 hours later mommy came out ... Also alive. 2 weeks later she was discharged from hospital and immediately we gave her even more Mannatech products. Today she is doing much better and her heart function is also much better than what the doctors said it would ever be. Our grandson was in Neo Natal ICU for 3 months and 1 week and the day he was discharged we put him on Immunostart to build his immune system. He turned 10 on the 1st March this year and he is a super clever and very healthy little lad. He is still on Immunostart, Mannabears, Omega 3 and GI Probalance as well. This is such a big miracle and do we want to thank the Lord for opening the doors for Mannatech to come to South Africa. Then we also want to thank our amazing 2 Star Platinum Presidential Couple Louis and Leonie vd Linde, for bringing Mannatech to South Africa and  giving hope to so many people.

                <h2>More Testimonials</h2>
                <li>My little girl is ten years old and was diagnosed with focal epilepsy three years ago. We did a 24 hour EEG on her and she had seizures, excised, and hyperventilated into her sleep. She is on OSP/Ambrotose Complex combo, Omega 3 and Mannabears. After an EEG last November, her epilepsy is no longer focal epilepsy but "juvenile" epilepsy that she can outgrow. She no longer has seizures in her sleep or hyperventilates. The only thing she had seizures was because the epilepsy pills' level in her bloodstream was two, meaning it was almost zero. The doctors couldn't believe she wasn't having more seizures. I'm firmly convinced that these products are working to keep her epilepsy in check. Cecilia.

                <li>My boy (now 4) was constantly sick with his chest two years back, on antibiotics every two weeks. He was chronically on an asthma pump, antihistamines, and all sorts of medications. A friend gave me a bottle of Mannabears as a gift and since then he has only been on antibiotics for his breast once. We no longer use the asthma pump or antihistamines or any chronic medications.
                </li><br>
                <li>A friend of mine's son chronically gets croup (8 times last year). They started Mannabears a month back and she let me know last night that even though he currently has croup, they can treat it this time without antibiotics. It's already an improvement.
                </li><br>
                <li>Allergies and Sinus (MannaBears). So why is my 5-year old 's MONTHLY prescription for April, for allergies and sinus not empty at the beginning of September? Simply put, he hasn't needed it again. The only thing that changed was we started giving him Mannabears in the middle of February every day. No further doctor's visits, no seasonal allergies, stuffy nose after about 2 months. Telfast costs about R315 for 300ml every month. Then, of course, add the doctor's consultation and Omnair and I paid anything between R700 and R1000 per month for 1 child. Finding a natural alternative has been so worth it.
